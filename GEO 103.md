## Geologic Time - Concepts/Principles
* Grand Canyon
    * 1 billion yrs of history
* examine rocks we learn
    * mountain building
    * advancing/retreating shallow seas
* we know because:
    * applying principles of relative dating
    * recognizing present day processes throughout Earth history

## Concept of Geologic Time
* **relative dating** - involves placing geologic events in sequential order
    * doesn't tell us the numbers
    * used relative dating for hundreds of years

#### Relative Geologic Time Scale
* has:
    * eons
    * eras
    * periods
    * epochs
        * EEPE - Eons Eras Periods Epochs
* no numbers indicating how long ago each of these times occurred

* second frame of reference is **absolute dating**
    * results in specific dates
        * expressed in years before the present
    * tells us how long ago an event was
* radiometric dating is most common method of obtaining absolute ages
    * such dates calculated from natural rates of decay of various natural radioactive elements in trace amounts in some rocks/minerals
    * developed throughout 20th Century

#### Changing Concept of Geologic Time
* **de Buffon** - calculated time to cool Earth from molten state using melted iron balls
* **Kelvin** - used thermal calculations and estimated 20-400 m.y. but did not consider heat from radioactivity
* others estimated rates of sediment/deposition & thickness of sedimentary rocks gave values of 1 mil. to 2 mil. years
* **Joly** estimated rate salt carried by rivers to ocean & salinity of seawater
    * obtained min. age of 90 mi. years
        * ~60 million years is what we have now

#### Relative-Dating Principles
* 6 fundamental geologic principles
    * **principle of superposition**
        * **Nicolas Steno**
            * in undisturbed succession of sedimentary rock layers, oldest is @ bottom and youngest is @ top
            * determining relative age of rock layers (strata) and fossils
            * ex. Chattanooga Shale, TN
    * **principle of original horizontality (Steno)**
        * sediment deposited in near horizontal layers
        * sequence of steeply inclined sedimentary layers must have been tilted after deposition
    * **principle of lateral continuity (Steno)**
        * layers extend laterally in all direction until thins/pinches out or ends against edges/depositional basin
            * Grand Canyon
    * **principle of cross-cutting relationships**
        * James Hutton
        * igneous intrusion/fault must be younger than rocks it intrudes/displaces
    * **principle of inclusions**
    * **principle of fossil succession**

### Neptunism v. Catastrophism
* Neptunism (Werner)
    * all rocks (granite/basalt) came from primeval, worldwide ocean
* Catastrophism (Cuvier) 
    * history of Earth came from 6 sudden widespread catastrophes
    * accounted for significant/rapid changes in Earth & exterminated existing life
    * 6 catastrophes - 6 days of biblical creation and last one was biblical flood
* both hypotheses were abandoned
    * not supported by evidence
    * basalt was igneous
    * more than 6 extinctions

### Uniformitarianism
* **principle of uniformitarianism (Hutton)**
    * advocated by Charles Lyell
    * present-day processes throughout geologic time
    * Hutton viewed Earth as cyclical
    * recognized geologic processes happened over and over over much time
    * modern view is that principles/laws of nature are constant but rates/intensities are varied
![[1675695302.png]]

> Uncomformity - difference in rock shape/structure next to each other (Ex. Siccar Point). Erosional surface represents gap in rock record

### Absolute-Dating Methods
* radioactivity is spontaneous decay of atom's nucleus to more stable form
* heat from radioactivity helps explain why Earth is still warm
* radioactivity provides geologists a way to measure absolute ages of rocks/minerals


#### Isotopes & Radioactive Decay
* Atomic mass number(Z) = protons + neutrons
* different isotopes of same element have diff. atomic mass numbers but behave the same (same protons) -> diff neutrons
* most isotopes are stable but some are not
* can use decay rates of unstable isotopes to determine absolute ages of rocks
* radioactive decay is where unstable atomic nucleus changes into atomic nucleus of diff. element
* 3 main types of radioactive decay
    * alpha decay
        * 2 protons/2 neutrons (alpha particle) emitted from nucleus
    * beta decay
        * neutron emits fast moving nuclear electron (beta particle) => becomes proton
    * electronic capture decay
        * proton captures electron & converts to neutron
    * some isotopes go through only one decay step before stableness
        * Rb decays to Sr by single beta emission
        * K decays to Ar by single electron capture

### Half-Lives
* time it takes for one half of the atoms of original unstable parent isotope to decay to atoms of a more stable daughter isotope
* half-life of specific radioactive isotope is constant/measurable
* time for half lives vary from less than 1/billionth of a section to 49 bil. years
* radioactive decay is geometric & not linear

#### Geometric Radioactive Decay
> during each equal time unit of one half-life, proportion of parent atoms decreases by 1/2

### Determining Age
* Measuring parent/daughter ratio and knowing half-life of parent
    * geologists can calculate age of sample containing radioactive element
* parent/daughter ratio determined by **mass spectrometer**
    * measures proportions of atoms with different masses

>Example: rock has parent/daughter ratio of 1:3
>= a parent proportion of 25%
>- half life is 57 mil. years
>* how old is the rock?
>25% means it is 2 half-lives old
>rock is 57*2 = 114 mil. years old

### What Materials Can Be Dated?
* most radiometric dates are obtained from igneous rocks
* when magma cools/crystallize, radioactive parent atoms separate from formed daughter atoms
* radioactive parents included in crystal structure of certain minerals because they fit
* daughter atoms are different elements with diff. sizes and therefore do not generally fit into the same minerals as the parents
* geologists can use crystals containing parent atoms to date time of crystallization
* U-Pb dating of mineral zircon is highly precise


### Igneous Crystallization
* crystallization of magma separates parent atoms from previous daughters
* resets radiometric clock to 0
* parents gradually decay

### Not Sedimentary Rocks
* (classic sedimentary) cannot be radiometrically dated
* any date obtained corresponds to avg. time of crystallization of individual clasts -- not the time it was deposited as a sedimentary particle

* possible to date authigenic sedimentary minerals that form during formation of sedim. rock
* possible to date interbedded volcanic ash layers (commonly contain igneous zircon) - very important

#### Dating Sedim. Rocks
* attempts to date sedim. rocks:
    * glauconite & other clay minerals
        * gives young ages suggesting problems with open system
    * calcite
        * susceptible to altercation but unaltered sedimentary calcite can date sedimentation
    * dolomite
        * results from altercation of limestones but based on present-day formation, date sedimentation within uncertainty
    * quartz/chert
        * potential for dating but usually igneous/metamorphic
        * chert has problems with "open system behavior"
### Sources of Uncertainty
> Closed system is needed for accurate date
    > neither parent/daughter atoms have been added or removed from sample since crystallization
* if leakage of daughters:
    * partially resets radiometric clock
    * age will be too young
* if parents escape, date will be too old
* most reliable dates use multiple methods
* during metamorphism, some daughter atoms may escape
    * leads to a date too young
    * if all daughters are forced out, then date obtained would be time of metamorphism - useful
* dating techniques are always improving 
    * presently measurement error <0.5% of the age, and sometimes better than 0.1%
    * date of 540mil:
        * +- 2.7 mil years or as low as +-0.54 mil

### Dating Metamorphism
* mineral crystallizes from magma
* time passes, parent atoms decay to daughter atoms
* metamorphism drives daughter atoms out of mineral as it recrystallizes
* dating mineral today yields age of 350 m.y = time of metamorphism provided system remains closed

### Long-Lived Radioactive Isotope Pairs Used in Dating
* isotopes used in radiometric dating need to be long lived so amount of parent material left is measurable
![[1675868675.png]]

### Radiocarbon Dating Method
* Carbon is in all life
* 3 isotopes
    * 12,13 stable and 14 is not
    * 14 has half life of 5730
    * 14 uses C-14/C-12 ratio of material that was once living
    * short half life of 14 makes it suitable for dating material < 70,000 - 100,000 years old
    * not useful for most rocks but useful for archaeology and young geologic materials

#### Carbon-14
* constantly forms in upper atmosphere
* cosmic ray strikes nitrogen 14 atom -> absorbed by nucleus & eject a proton => changing it to C-14
* C14 formation rate fairly constant - calibrated against tree rings
* becomes part of natural carbon cycle => incorporated into organisms
* if organisms continues to live, takes in more c14, but when dead, c14 decays
* c14 dating measures time of death


### Tree-Ring Dating Method
* age of tree => counting annual growth rings in lower stem (trunk)
* width of rings => climate and correlated from tree to tree **cross-dating** (trees with overlapping time spans)
* tree-ring time scale - 14,000 years



# Ch. 5

## Rocks, Fossils, and Time

* Earth changed over time
*  geologic record is record of events preserved in rocks
*  sedimentary rocks more useful
*  geologic record is more complex
*  uniformitarianism is useful for this

## Stratigraphy
* study of any layered rock but primarily sedimentary
    * composition
    * origin
    * age relationships
    * geographic extent
* sedimentary rocks are nearly all stratified
* many igneous rocks (succession of lava flows/ash beds) are also stratified/obey princip. of stratigraphy
* many metamorphic rocks are stratified too

## Vertical Stratigraphic Relationships
* bedding planes separate one strata from another
* strata grade vertically from 1 rock to another
* rocks above/below diff in comp. texture, color or combin. of features
* bedding plane => change in sedimentation/period of nondeposition

## Superposition
* Nicolas Steno: determine relative ages of horizontal strata by position in sequence
* if deformed strata, harder to determine
    * some sedimentary structs. (cross bedding) & fossils can help solve this

## Principle of Inclusions
* determine relative ages
* inclusions/fragments older than rock itself

## Age of Lava Flows, Sills
* determine relative ages of lava flows
    * altercation by heat
    * inclusion
    * determining if a layer of basalt is buried lava flow/sill
        * lava flow forms in sequence with sedimentary layers
        * rocks below - signs of heating but not rocks above
        * rocks above may have clasts from underlying lava flow
        
## Unconformities
* Conformable strata
    * seq. of rocks in deposition was mostly continuous
* Unconformities
    * non-deposition and/or erosion
        * long periods of geologic time
        * millions/tens of mil, or hundred mils of years (Siccar Point)
    * rock record is incomplete
        * termed hiatus

## Origin of an Unconformity
* deposition began 12 mil years ago until 4 mil yrs ago
    * for 1 mil yrs, erosion occurred removing 2 Myr of rocks
    * rise to 3 mil year hiatus
* last column is actual stratigraphic record with conformity

## Types of Unconformities
1. disconformity - separation of younger from older rocks (both parallel)
2. nonconformity - erosional surface cut into metamorphic/intrusive rocks and covered by sedim. rocks
3. angular conformity - erosional surface on titled/folded strata over younger rocks
![[1676040120.png]]

- unconformities on regional extent may vary from one type to another
-  does not represent same amount of geologic time

## Lateral Relationships
* Steno proposed Principle of Lateral Continuity
    * layers of sedim. extend outward until terminate
    * termination => maybe abrupt @ edge of depositional basin
        * eroded/truncated by faults

## Sedimentary Facies
* intertonguing/lateral gradation indicate simultaneous deposition in environments
* sedimentary facies - body of sediment with distinctive physical/chemical/biological attributes deposited side by side with other sediments
* continental shelf -> sand may accumulate in high energy nearshore environment
* mud/carbonate deposition takes place @ same time as offshore low energy environment

## Marine Transgressions
* sea level rises to land
* shoreline migrates landward
* environments parallel to shoreline
* laterally adjacent depositional environment => sedimentary facies
* faces forming offshore => superposed upon facies
* rocks of each facies => younger 
    * time transgressive - ages vary from place to place
* younger shale on top, older shale on bottom

Ex. Marine Transgression in Grand Canyon
* 3 formations:
    * Muav Limestone (top)
    * Bright Angel Shale (middle)
    * Tapeats Sandstone (bottom)

### Marine Regression
* sea level falls w/ respect to continent
    * other way around compared to marine transgression
    * upward slope
    * younger shale on bottom and older shale is offshore
    * environments parallel to shoreline migrate seaward

### Walther's Law
* Walther recognized facies found laterally => yields a vertical sequence
* Law: facies found in a conformable vertical sequence also existed beside one another laterally
    * applies to marine transgression/regressions


## Extent, Rates & Cause of Transgressions& Regressions
* 6 major transgressions in NA
* gives major sequences (bounded by unconformities)
* subsidence => transgression
* continent uplift => regression
* seafloor spreading => expands mid ocean ridge & displaces seawater onto continents
* widespread glaciation causes regression
* diminishing seafloor spreading => increases volume of ocean basins => regression

## Relative Ages between Separate Areas
* relative dating can determine relative ages of rocks in columns A and B
* need more info to determine actual ages of rocks in one section relative to other
* rocks in A may be younger/older/or same age as B
* fossils solves this!

### Fossils
* most common in sedimentary and pyroclastic materials (esp. ash)
* useful for determining relative ages of strata
* ascertain environments of deposition
* provide evidence for organic evolution

* body fossils - remains of organisms
* consist mostly of durable skeletal elements 
    * bones
    * teeth
    * shells
* rarely find entire animals preserved by freezing/mummification

### Trace Fossils
* indications of organic activity:
    * tracks
    * trails
    * burrows
    * nests called trace fossils
        * spiral burrow made by land dwelling beaver - Paleocastor
        * **coprolite** - type of trace fossil consisting of fossilized feces - gives size/diet of animal


### Body Fossil Formation
* fossils are preserved usually when organism has durable skeleton and lives where burial is likely
* body fossils can be preserved as:
    * unaltered remains
        * retain original comp. & struct. by freezing/mummification
        * in amber or tar
    * altered remains
        * some change in comp. & struct.
        * permineralized, recrystallized, replaced, carbonized

#### Unaltered Remains
* insects in amber
* preservation in tar
* 40,000 year old frozen baby mammoth
* found in Siberia in 1971
* hairy coat - hair around feet still visible

#### Altered Remains
* petrified tree stump in Florissant, Colorado
* silica has replaced organic materials
* volcanic mudflows covered lower parts of trees
* carbon film of palm frond
* carbon film of insect

## Molds & Casts
* molds form when buried remains leave cavity
* casts form if material fills in cavity

![[1676472910.png]]

* cast of turtle
    * body fossil & cast
![[1676473012.png]]

## Fossil Record
* record of ancient life preserved as fossils in rocks
* must be analyzed in rocks & analyzed
* repository of prehistoric organisms that provides only knowledge of extinct animals (trilobytes/dinosaurs)
* incomplete due to:
    * bacterial decay
    * physical processes
    * scavenging
    * metamorphism destroy organic remains
* fossils are remarkably common

## Fossils & Telling Time
* William Smith
    * discovered Steno's principle of superposition & fossils 
    * discovered sequences of fossils esp. groups of fossils consistent from area to area
    * discovered method of relative dating of sedimentary rocks at diff. locations
    * to compare rocks from 2 diff. locations, Smith used fossils

## Principle of Fossil Succession
* using superposition, Smith predicted order in which fossils would appear in rocks not previously visited
    * Alexander Brongniart also recognized relationship
* **Principle of fossils succession**
    * superposition applied to fossils
    * fossil assemblages succeed one another through time
* Why not match up similar rock types?
    * because same rocks formed repeatedly through time (Walther's Law)
* fossil assemblages are unique

![[1676473721.png]]


## Relative Geologic Time Scale
* developed through investigations of rocks by naturalists
* based on superposition/fossil succession
* resulted in discovery of rock bodies called **systems**
    * construction of composite geologic column - basis of relative geologic time scale
> estimates of absolute ages added much later

##  Example of Development of Systems
* Cambrian System
    * system could not be recognized beyond area
    * **Sedgwick** studied rocks in northwen Wales
    * described Cambrian system without fossils
* Silurian System
    * **Murchinson** described Silurian system in south Wales
    * included fossils
    * system can be recognized

### Dispute of Systems

* Ordovician System
    * great controversy in rock assignment
    * Lapworth solved the problem
    * assigned overlap btwn both Cambrian & Silurian to a new system
        * Ordovician (correct)


## Stratigraphic Terminology
* sedimentary rocks are time transgressive
    * belong to one system in one area & another system elsewhere
    * some localities rock unit straddles boundaries btwn systems
    * rocks - defined by content
        * lithostratigraphic unit - rock content
        * biostratigraphic unit - fossil content
    * time - expressing or relating to geologic time
        * time-stratigraphic unit - rocks of a certain age
        * time units - referring to time and not rocks

### Lithostratigraphic Units
* based on rock type
* no consideration of time/origin
* basic lithostratigraphic element is formation
    * mappable rock unit with distinctive upper/lower boundaries
* may be single rock type or variety of rock types
* formations divided into:
    * subdivided into *members* & *beds*
    * collected into *groups* & *supergroups*

### Biostratigraphic Units
* body of strata recognized on basis of fossil content is biostratigraphic unit
* boundaries do not correspond to those of lithostratigraphic units
* fundamental biostratigraphic unit is the **biozone**


### Time-Stratigraphic & Time Units
* Time-stratigraphic or Chronostratigraphic Unit
    * rocks deposited during a particular interval of geologic time
* basic time unit is System
* Time or Geochronological Units designate certain parts of geologic time
* basic time unit is **Period** corresponds to System
    * 2 or more Periods -> Era
    * 2 or more Eras -> Eon
* periods can be subdivided into Epochs which can be subdivided into Ages
![[1676726713.png]]

## Correlation
* process of matching up rocks in diff. areas
* 2 types:
    * Lithostratigraphic correlation matches up same rock units over large area with no regard for time
    * Time-stratigraphic correlation demonstrates time-equivalence of events
![[1676726901.png]]

### Lithostratigraphic Correlation
* correlate rock units based on
    * composition
    * position in sequence
    * presence of distinctive key beds

## Time Equivalence
* most rocks of regional extent are:
    * time transgressive
    * cannot rely on lithostratigraphic correlation to demonstrate time equivalence
* Ex.
    * sandstone in Arizona -> similar to rocks in Colorado/South Dakota
    * age of these rocks varies from Early Cambrian in west to middle Cambrian farther east
* most effective way to demonstrate time equivalence is time-stratigraphic correlation using biozones
* other methods (paleomagnetic/radiometric dating) are also useful

### Biozones
* for extinct organisms, existence marks 2 points in time
    * origin
    * extinction
* types of biozones - **range zone** - defined by geologic range (total time of existence) of particular fossil group
    * species/group of related species called genus
* most useful fossils that are 
    * easily identified
    * geographically widespread
    * had short geologic range

## Guide Fossils
* brachiopod *Lingula* is not useful
* easily identified/wide geographic extent, too large of a geologic range
* brachiopod *Atrypa* and trilobite *Paradoxides* are well suited for time-stratigraphic correlation because of short ranges
* termed _guide_ or _index fossils_

### Concurrent Range Zones
* established by plotting overlapping ranges of two or more fossils with diff. geologic ranges
* most accurate method of determining time equivalence
![[1676727477.png]]

## Short Duration Physical Events
* some geologic events of short duration may be used for time equivalence
    * distinctive lava flow over short period of time
    * ash falls occur in hours/days
    * cover large areas and not restricted to specific environment
* absolute ages obtained for igneous events using radiometric dating

![[1676727571.png]]

## Absolute Dates & Relative Geologic Time Scale
* Ordovician rocks younger than those of Cambrian & Silurian rocks
* radiometric dating techniques work on igneous and some metamorphic rocks, but not generally on sedimentary rocks

## Absolute Ages for Sedimentary Rocks are INDIRECT
* determined indirectly by dating associated igneous & metamorphic rocks
* sedimentary age constrained by principle of cross-cutting relationships, e.g.:
    * dike must be younger than sedimentary rocks it cuts, so absolute age of dike gives minimum age for sedimentary rock
    * also gives maximum age for any sedimentary rocks deposited across dike after it was eroded


## Indirect Dating
* absolute dates of regionally metamorphosed rocks => give maximum age for overlying sedimentary rocks
* lava flows/ash falls => most useful for determining absolute ages
    * gives maximum age for rocks above and minimum age for rocks below
* combines thousands of absolute ages associated with sedimentary rocks of known relative ages gives numbers on geologic time scale

## Sedimentary Rocks - Archives of Earth History

* sedimentary rocks preserve evidence of surface depositional processes
* may contain fossils
* gives clues to depositional environment - specific area/environment where sediment is deposited

## Sedimentary Rocks
* detrital
* chemical (including biochemical)
* preserve evidence of physical/chemical/biological processes that formed them
* some sedimentary rocks are/contain resources such as:
    * phosphorous
    * liquid petroleum
    * natural gas
    * certain metal (lead, zinc, silver, uranium)

## Investigating Sedimentary Rocks
* qualities
    * textures
    * composition
    * fossils
    * thickness
    * relationships to other rocks
* preliminary interpretations:
    * red rocks may have been deposited on land 
    * greenish rocks more typical of marine deposits
* more detailed study in lab
    * microscopic examination
    * chemical analyses
    * fossil identification
    * interpretation of vertical/lateral facies relationships
    * compare with present-day sediments

## Composition of Sedimentary Rocks
* **detrital sedimentary rocks**
    * common minerals include quartz/feldspars, and clay minerals
    * composition tells about source rocks, weathering history
        * e.g., quartz sand may have been deposited in river/beach/sand dunes
* **chemical sedimentary rocks**
    * different composition
    * revealing environmental info
    * limestone deposited mostly in warm/shallow seas
    * evaporites - indicate arid environment w/ high evaporation rates
    * coal originates in swamps/bogs on lang -- usually marine

## Sediment Texture
* grain size
    * gives indication of energy conditions
    * large particles (gravel/sand) require high energy
    * small particles (silt/clay) - weak energy
    * silt is transported by wind and primary constituent in loess deposits
* sorting/rounding
    * 2 textural features reflecting particle size distributions and shapes
    * provide info of environmental energy
    * sorting - large particle size range is poorly sorted; small particle size range is well sorted
    * rounding - degree of which detrital particles have sharp corners & edges warn away by abrasion

![[1676904214.png]]

## Sedimentary Structures
* features visible @ outcrops scale
    * formed @ or short after after time of deposition
    * manifestations of physical/biological processes 
* see in modern environments/produced in experiments provide info about depositional environments of similar structs. in ancient rocks

* major sedimentary structs.
    * bedding/stratification (various types)
    * ripple marks
    * desiccation features (mud cracks)
    * biogenic structs.
* single structs. rarely diagnostic of environment
    * need several consistent structs. to interpret

## Bedding
* sedimentary rocks generally have bedding/stratification
    * beds are thicker than 1 cm
        * common in rocks w/ coarser grains
    * individual layers less than 1 cm thick are laminations
        * common in mudrocks

### Graded Bedding
* upward gradual decrease in grain size
* common in turbidity current deposits
    * form when sediment-water mixtures flow along seafloor
* as they slow, particles settle in order of size/density

* Top of Bed - fine grained
* Bottom of Bed - coarse grained

### Cross Bedding
* forms when layers come to rest @ an angle to surface where they accumulate
    * downwind on side of sand dune
* form by transport by water/wind
* inclined/dip downward in direction of prevailing current
* indicate ancient/current directions, or paleocurrent
* useful for relative dating of deformed sedimentary rocks
![[1676905414.png]]
* planar cross-beds
* trough cross-beds

## Ripple Marks
* common on bedding planes especially in sandstone
* current ripple marks - form in response to water/wind currents from one direction
    * asymmetrical profiles
* wave formed ripple marks - result from have motion
    * symmetrical
* useful for relative dating of deformed sedimentary rocks
![[1676905629.png]]


## Mud Cracks
* polygonal fracture pattern resulting when clay-rich sediments drives/shrinks
    * requires wetting/drying to form
        * lakeshore flood plain, low tide exposure
        * cracks typically filed with overlying sediment
![[1676905689.png]]

## Biogenic Sedimentary Structures
* biogenic sedimentary structures include:
    * tracks
    * burrows
    * trails
* called **trace fossils**
* extensive burrowing by organisms - bioturbation
    * may disrupt/obliterate other structures

## Bioturbation
![[1677075734.png]]

## Geometry of Sedimentary Rocks
* 3 dimensional geometry of sedimentary body => helpful for environmental analyses
    * generally not unique
    * susceptible to modification (compaction, lithification,. erosion, deformation)
* blanket (sheet-like) geometry typical of marine settings
* elongate (shoe-string) typical of river deposits
* other geometry - lens/lobate (deltas) and irregular (reefs)

##  Fossils--Biological Content of Sedimentary Rocks
* fossils
    * used in stratigraphy for relative dating/correlation
    * constituents of rocks
    * provide evidence of depositional environment
* many limestone composed party or entirely of shells / shell fragments
* much deep-sea sediment consists of microscopic shells


## Fossils in Environmental Analyses
* Did the organisms live where they were buried? Remains/fossils transported there?
    * dinosaur fossils indicate deposition in land environment such as river floodplain
    * if bones are found in rocks with clams/corals/sea lilies, can assume carcass washed out to sea
* can evaluate habitat of organism
    * thick-shell clams => lived in turbulent water
    * corals live in shallow water (photosynthesis)
* microfossils => practical use (oil exploration)
* trace fossils (in place)



## Depositional Environments
* is present anywhere sediment accumulates
* 3 broad areas of deposition:
    * continental
    * transitional
    * marine
    * each has numerous specific environments

### Continental Environments
* sediment deposition on continents (land)
    * fluvial systems - river/streams - braided and meandering rivers
* deserts - dunes/alluvial fans, playa lakes
* areas covered by and adjacent to glaciers 

#### Braided Stream
* multiple broad/shallow channels in which sheets of gravel/cross bedded sand are deposited
* mud nearly absent
![[1677076716.png]]
![[1677076734.png]]

##### Meandering Stream
* winding channels with fine-grained sediment w/ floodplain
* cross-bedding sand bodies w/ shoestring geometry
* _point-bars_ - sand body overlying w/ erosion surface that developed on convex side of meander

![[1677076996.png]]
![[1677077004.png]]

#### Desert Environment
* association of features found in:
    * sand dunes
    * alluvia fans
    * playa lakes

![[1677077136.png]]

#### Glacial Environments

* **Drift**: sediment deposited in glacial environments
* **Till**: poorly sorted/nonstratified drift deposited from glacial ice often in ridge-like **moraines**
* **Outwash**: sand/gravel deposited by braided streams from melting glaciers
* **Varves**: annual glacial lake deposits, w/ **dropstones** from icebergs/floating ice
* Striated & polished bedrock gives us evidence that glaciers are involved

![[1677077652.png]]


### Transitional Environments
* has both marine/continental processes
    * ex. river enters sea to form delta - deposits modified by marine processes such as waves/tides
* includes:
    * deltas
    * beaches
    * barrier islands
    * lagoons
    * tidal flats
#### Simple Deltas
* aka lakes, consists of:
    * in ascending order:
        * bottomset, foreset, and topset beds
    * coarsens upward as delta builds outward (progrades) into water body)

> Progrades: (of a coastline) advance toward the sea due to waterborne sediment or as delta builds outward into water body

#### Marine Deltas
* 3 major types of deltas
    * stream dominated (Mississippi)
    * wave dominated (Nile)
    * tide dominated (Ganges)

#### Barrier (Beach Islands)
* sandy continental margins separated from shore by lagoon
* sub-environments (seaward to landward):
        * offshore muds/fine sands
        * beach sands
        * dune sands w/ shell fragments NOT from desert
        * lagoon deposits w/ marine fossils/bioturbation

#### Tidal Flats
* present where shoreline covered by seawater @ high tide and then exposed as low tide
* prograde seaward yielding sequence of rocks grading upward from sand => sand
* **FEATURE**: sets of cross beds that dip in opposite directions
![[1677078544.png]]


### Marine Environment
* detritus eroded from continents => eventually deposited in marine environments
* marine sediment derived from chemical/organic activity 
    * limestone
    * evaporites
* environments include:
    * continental shelf
    * continental slope
    * continental rise
    * deep-seafloor

### Detrital Marine Environments
* transition seaward
	* **continental shelf** - gentle slopes/high energy (waves & tides)
	* **continental slope** - sudden increase in slope - little sediment deposited but transported to deeper water in submarine canyons
	* **continental rise** - at base of slope where sediment accumulates in fan shaped deposits
	* **abyssal plain** - deep-sea transitioned from continental rise
![[Pasted image 20230224092337.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230224092500.png]]

### Deep Sea Environments
* deep seafloor covered by fine-grained sediment
* sediment sources:
	* windblown dust from continents/oceanic islands
	* shells of microorganisms dwelling in ocean
	* volcanic ash
* sediment types:
	* pelagic clay (covers most of deep seafloor)
	* calcareous & siliceous oozes consisting of microscopic shells

## Carbonate Environments
* limestones (calcite) & dolostones (dolomite)
* limestone similar textures to detrial sediments but all grains are calcite
* form mostly in environments of deposition & not transported there
* most limestone deposited in warm shallow seas
	* carbonate shelves
	* carbonate platforms rise from oceanic depths
* deposition occurs @ little detrital sediment
* carbonate barriers form in high-energy areas
	* reefs
	* banks of skeletal particles
	* accumulations of spherical carbonate grains *oolites* which make up grains in *oolitic limestone*

#### Carbonate Shelf & Platform
![[Pasted image 20230224093154.png]]


#### Evaporite Environments
* evaporites consists of:
	* rock salt
	* rock gypsum
* environments:
	* playa lakes
	* saline lakes
	* mostly as extensive deposits formed in ocean
* uncommon
* high seawater evaporation rates caused minerals to precipitate from solution
* coastal arid environments (e.g. **Persian Gulf**)
* large (> 2 km thick) deposits beneath Mediterranean seafloor
	* e.g. **western Canada, Michigan, Ohio, New York,, and several Gulf Coast states**
**![[Pasted image 20230224093438.png]]

## Interpreting Depositional Environments
* interpreted through combination of geological mapping/stratigraphy, sedimentary composition & sedimentary features

* Navajo Sandstone (Jurassic) ![[Pasted image 20230224093717.png]]


*  Ancient desert dunes ![[Pasted image 20230224093758.png]]

## Paleogeography
* deals w/ reconstructing Earth's past geography
* uses interpretations of depositional environment
* ex:
	* Navajo Sandstone: vast desert during Jurassic Period
	* Late Precambrian to Middle Cambrian North America shoreline migrated inland from east and west during marine transgression
	* reconstruction of late Creaceous (~75 Myr) in western USA indicates coastal plain
	* Eocene (~50 Myr) area covers large lakes/river floodplains

# Ch. 7
## Evidence for Evolution
* some evidence for evolution is from fossils
	* Early Pleistocene mammoth Archidiskodon meridonalis
		* Museum of Geology & Plaeontology - Uni. of Florence Italy
* Paleontology is study of history of life with fossils

## Darwin and the Galápagos
* observations made leading to the theory of evolution during 5 year voyage on *HMS Beagle* to the islands
* prior to voyage, Darwin subscribed to "fixity of species" concept and biblical accounts


## Darwin Developed Theory
* he observed
	* S. American fossil mammals similar yet different from present-day llamas, sloths, and armadillos
	* flinches & giant tortoises vary between islands but generally resemble ones from S. America
* he became convinced that organisms descended with modification from ancestors that lived during the past
	* central claim of theory of evolution
* **Darwin's flinches**:
	* beak shapes differ depending on available diet
	* evolved from common ancestor

## Evolution
* fundamental to bio/paleontology
* *unifying* theory
* misconceptions:
	* eovlution happens by chance
	* no transitional fossils - so called missing links - connecting ancestors to descendants
	* humans evolved from monkeys so no monkeys
* early ideas came from ancient Greece but literal biblical descriptions for development of life prevailed until mid 19th century
* uniformitarianism paved intellectual path for new theories

### Early Idea - Lamarck
* Lamarck developed: *inheritance of acquired characteristics*
	* new traits in organisms arise due to needs & passed down to descendants
	* not widely accepted and not refuted until genes not changed by effort

### Darwin
* published *On the Origin of Species*
* detailed ideas of evolution 20 yrs earlier
* proposed mechanism for evolution by natural selection
* idea from observing plant/animal breeeders who artificially select for desirablable traits thru breeding
* recognized selection in nature => bring change
* influenced by Malthus' work
	* competition : mechanism for selection
	* competition for resources / high infant mortality

#### Natural Selection
* organisms possess heritable variations
* some variations more favorable
* provide competitive edge/avoiding predators
* not all young survive to reproduction
	* more favorable variations => more likely to survive and pass on favorable variations
* Darwin & Wallace came to same conclusion
	* cofounders of this thought but Darwin had been thinking of evolution for >20 years


#### Naturally Selected Giraffes
* longer neck evolved => ancestors with longer necks had an advantage & reproduced often

#### "Survival of the Fittest"
* misleading - natural selection not just matter of survival but involves differential rates of survival/reproduction
* misconception is that biggest/strongest/fastest are likely to survive but selection may favor
	* smaller
	* most easily concealed
	* adapt most readily to a new food source
* natural selection worked on existing variation in population
	* did not account for origin of variations
	* critics reasoned variant trait would blend w/ other traits and be lost
	* answer to these criticisms was in genetics

### Mendel & Genetics
* performed experiments on strains of garden peas that when self-fertilized display same trait - true breeding
* traits controlled by pairs of *genes*
* genes occur in alternate forms called *alleles*
	* one may be dominant
	* offspring receive one allele of each pair from each parent
* his work to evolution:
	* factors (genes) do not blend during inheritance
	* traits not expressed may be lost
	* some variation results from alternate expressions of genes
	* variation can be maintained

#### Genes & Chromosomes
* double-stranded helical molecules of DNA called chromosomes
	* found in ells of all organisms except bacteria which have **RNA**
	* DNA segments - **genes** - basic units of heredity
	* fruit flies: 8; humans: 46; horses: 64
* reproduction thru meiosis (sexually) or mitosis (asexually)
	* meiosis: half chromosomes from each aprent
	* mitosis: cell divides & fully reproduce chromosomes
	* mitosis take place in all but sex cells


### Modern View of Evolution
* modern views accelerated by paleontologists, biologists, geneticists
	* incorporated chromosome theory of inheritance
	* recognized mutation of genes a source of variation
	* rejected Lamarkian views of inheritance
* current controversies related to pace of evolutionary change
	* gradual v. "punctuated equilibrium"


#### Variation
* chromosomal mutations - affect large segment of chromosome
* point mutations - individual changes in particular gene
* mutations are random
	* random or result from **mutagen**: UV radiation, X-rays, certain chemicals
	* most mutations are neutral/harmful having little/no evolutionary impact
	* some gives improved competitive advantage & propogates

### Species/Speciation
* species that interbreed to produce fertile offspring
	* reproductively isolated species
		* goats/sheeps do not interbreed in nature so diff. species
		* horses/donkeys reproduce but form infertile offspring so also separate speies
* **Speciation** is production of new species from ancestral species
	* involves genetic change in population
	* *allopatric speciation* is where small part of population becomes isolated from parent population
		* small pop. may evolve whereas larger parent pop. remain unchanged, evolve in new direction, or go extinct

#### Rate of Speciation
* widespread agreement on *allopatric speciation*
	* disagreement on rate
		* **Phyletic Gradualism** - slow accumulation of minor changes
		* **Puctuated Equilibrium** - rapid change followed by long periods of no change
		* both proccesses take place
![[Pasted image 20230227095623.png]]

#### Styles of Evolution
* three patterns:
	* *Divergent evolution* - ancestral species give rise to diverse descendants adapted to certain aspects of environment
	* *Convergent evolution* - involves development of similar characteristics in **distant** organisms
	* *Parallel evolution* - development of characteristics in **closely** related organisms
* divergent => descendants that differ greatly from ancestors
* convergent/parallel => similar characteristics are developed independently in comparable environments

![[Pasted image 20230227095228.png]]

## Cladograms & Cladistics
* **phylogenetic trees** express evolutionary relationships such as anatomical differences v. time
* **cladograms** show relationship among members of *clade* - group of organisms including most recent common ancestor
* *cladistics* examine derived characteristics - evolutionary novelties - as opposed to primitive / fundament characteristics

![[Pasted image 20230227095607.png]]

### Cladograms
* diff. interpretations of relationship among bats/dogs/birds
	* bats/birds fly = closer relationship than to dogs
	* dogs/birds do not appear closely related
	* hair and giving birth to live young indicate bats/dogs more closely related
* difficult applying to fossils - distinguishing primitive from derived characteristics & with convergent evolution

### Evolutionary Trends
* **Mosasic evolution**: organisms have both reently evolved and ancestral features
* during evolution, not all aspects change simultaneously
	* oldest birds had feathers/fused clavicles but retained reptile characteristics
* **Phylogeny** is evolutionary history of group
	* based on fossil record
	* size increase is most common
	* trends may be complex, variable rates, and to a degree, reversible 

#### Adapations 
* evolutionary trends
	* taking advantage of random mutations
* some organisms show little evolutionary change for long periods
* if still existing - living fossils
	* lingula - type of brachiopod
	* horseshoe crabs - related to trilobites
	* coelacanth (fish)
	* gingkos (tree)

##### Living Fossils
* Latimeria
	* belongs to group of fish
	* specimen caught in 1938 off coast of East Africa
* Ginkgos
	* changed very little fo rmillions of years
	* found in isolated habitats in Asia and transplanted elsewhere

## Extinctions
* 99% of all species are now extinct
* organisms do not always evolve toward higher order of perfection
* natural selection yields organisms adapted to specific circumstances @ particular time
* **Background Extinction** - continual process
* **Mass Extinction** - periods of highly accelerated extinction rates
	* reduces diversity
	* often marks boundaries in geological time scale
	* greatest marks Paleozoic - Mesozoic boundary - 90% of species went extinct
	* most famous - Mesozoic - Cenozoic boundary - included demise of dinosuars

## Evidence Supporting Evolution
Darwin's Evidence:
	- classification
	- embryology
	- comparative anatomy
	- geographic distributions
	- fossil record
* little knowledge of mechanism of inheritance
	* biochem/molecular bio unknown @ his time
* new fields have tested theory:
	* biochem
	* molecular bio
	* more complete and better understanding of fossil record
* disagreements on details but central claim of evolution is widely accepted

## Classification
* uses nested pattern of shared characteristics - evidence of evolutionary relationship
* **Carolus Linneaus**
	* classification scheme - 2 part name
		* *genus* and *species* - e.g., coyote - *Canis latrans*
* ordered and becomes more inclusive moving up
	* coyote (Canis lantrans) and wolf (Canis lupus) share numerous charateristics as members of the same *genus*
	* share some but fewer characteristics with red fox (Volpes fulva) in the family Canidae
	* all canids share some characteristics with cats, bears, and weasels int he order Carnivora
	* Carnivora is one of the 18 living orders of class Mammalia

![[Pasted image 20230301111332.png]]

## Biological Evidence Supporting Evolution
* all life forms have fundamental similarities:
	* consist mainly of **C, N, H, and O**
	* chromosomes consist of DNA or Rna (bacteria)
	* all cells synthesize proteins in similar way
* provides evidence of evolutionary relationships
	* blood chemistry is similar among mammals and closer related organisms
	* biochemical tests support idea birds descended from reptiles
	* genetic similarities among related organisms
* similarities among structures in related organisms:
	* Homologous, Analogous (and Vestigial) structures


### Structures w/ similarities
* Homologous structures
	* similar structures modified for different functions
	* indicate common ancestor
* Analogous structures
	* similarities unrelated to evolutionary relationships
	* serve same function but dissimilar in both struct & development
* Vestigial structures
	* nonfunctional remants of structures that used to be functional in ancestors

![[Pasted image 20230301112051.png]]

#### Vestigial

Dogs:
* dogs have functionless toes
* ancestors had 5 toes touching ground
* evolved into toe-walkers w/ 4 toes on ground
* big toes/thumbs lost or reduced to present state

Horses:
* normally only third toe on horse's back functional
* splints are remnants of toes 2 and 4 that remain as vestiges
* occasionally, horses are born with one or both vestiges enlarged

# Ch. 8 

## Precambrian Earth & Life History--The Hadean and Archean

![[Pasted image 20230301121234.png]]
* Precambrian Archean

## Precambrian Time Span
![[Pasted image 20230301121305.png]]
* Precambrian: **88%** of geologic time
* Hadean: **13%**
* Archean: **33%**
* Proterozoic: **42%**


### Precambrian
* informal but widely used term referring to time & rocks
* includes time from Earth's origin 4.56 Gyr to beginning of Phanerozoic Eon 542 Myr
* no rocks known for first 560ish Myrs of geologic time - Hadean
* oldest known rocks on Earth are 4.03 Gyr Acasta Gneiss (northwest Canada)
* Precambrian record of geologic time difficult to interpret because for Precambrian rocks:
	* altered by metamorphism
	* complexly deformed
	* buried deep beneath younger rocks
	* fossisls are rare
	* the few fossils that are present are of little use in stratigraphy

### Eons of Precambrian
* subdivisions difficult to establish
* 3 formal eons for Precambrian
	* Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic
* **Hadean** Eon - name for time preceding rock record
* **Archean** Eon - covers:
	* begins w/ age of Earht's oldest known rocks ~4 Gyr 
	* ends at 2.5 Gyr - beginning of **Proterozoic** Eon
* Precambrian eons have no stratotypes
	* Cambrian Period based on Cambrian System of rocks
	* Precambrian eons - terms denoting time although controversial

![[Pasted image 20230301122126.png]]

### Precambrian Rocks
* exposed Precambrian rocks constitute Shields
* platforms consist of buried Precambrian rocks
* Shields and adjoining platforms make up cratons

## Continental Foundations
* continents consist of rocks with andesitic average compositions
* continental crust => thicker, more felsic & less dense than oceanic crust
* Precambrian shields consist of exposed ancient rocks & found on all continents
* beyond shields are broad platforms of buried Precambrian rocks underlying much of continents
* shields / platforms => cratons - continent's ancient nucleus
* rocks in cratons => highly metamorphosed, deformed, with abundant volcanism, but little activity since end of Precambrian

## Canadian Shield
![[Pasted image 20230301122620.png]]

### Canadian Shield Rocks
![[Pasted image 20230301122637.png]]
* **Metamorphic Gneiss** - Georgian Bay
* **Basalt (dark) & Granite (light)** - N. Ontario


### Amalgamated Cratons
* Canadian Shield & adajacent platform made up of numerous units/smaller Archean cratons
* cratons amalgamated during Late Archean and Early proterzoic
* absolute ages/structural trends idenitify smaller cratons
* drilling/geophysical evidence => Precambrian rocks underlie NA
	* in places exposed by erosion/uplift
![[Pasted image 20230303091815.png]]

### Hadean

* no rocks of Hadean age are present on Earth
	* except for meterorites
	* Hadean-aged minerals (e.g., detrital zircons)
* Hadean-aged rocks can be studied on Moon/Mars (including sedimentary)
* Hadean approaches:
	* uniformitarianism
	* theoretical modeling
	* ancient rocks preserving records of events
	* planetary/metoerite studies
* among events:
	* Earth accreted from planetsimals
	* differentiated into core, mantle, and some crust
	* bombarded by metorites
	* volcanic actvity was common
	* atmosphere formed but different from today's
	* oceans accumulate
#### Hadean Magma Ocean
* giant impact => formed moon resulted in melting of Earth
* formation of "magma ocean"

#### Hadean Earth
* shortly Fter accretion, Earth was:
	* rapidly rotating, hot, barren planet
	* high internal heat due to energy of accretion/high radioactivity
	* bombarded by comets/meteroites
	* likely no continents but widespread volcanism
	* intense cosmic radiation

#### Hadean Impact record
* after magma ocean cools, surface distrupted by massive meterorite impacts
* >200 basins > 1000 km between 4.1 - 3.8 Gyr
* spike on impacts ~3.85 Gyr
![[Pasted image 20230303092502.png]]
* rate at which asteroids/meterorites hit the Earth 
* logarithmic
#### Internal Heat Production
* ratio of radiogenic heat production in past compared to present
* greater heat production during Hadean - Early Archean due to leftover heat from accretion

#### Hadean Crust
* major controversy on Hadean crust
	* basaltic or felsic?
	* continental crust present? how much?
* widely accepted that basaltic crust was present
* insight about Hadean felsic crust comes from the oldest rocks
	* 4.03 Gyr Acasta Gneiss (Canada) suggest some differentiated crust (i.e., granite) evolved by 4 Gyr
	* sedimentary rocks in Australia contain detrital zircons (ZrSiO4) dated at up to 4.4 gyr 
	* zircons most common in felsic igneous rocks
* suggests that some felsic rocks present but uncertain if true continental crust or local occurrences
* Hadean crust likely:
	* thin
	* unstable
	* basaltic rocks
* mafic crust disrupted by upwelling basaltic magma at hot spots
* meteroite impacts far more common today 
	* likely disrupte crust w/ large impact craters (similar to surface of Moon)
* unlikely if plate techtonics similar to today existed then
* Hadean felsic rocks formed but no evidence of widespreadness
* possibility:
	* felsic rocks formed as part of differentiation of large pools of magma formed during meterorite impacts

#### Hadean Chronology:
* 4.0 Gyr:
	* beginning of preservation of geological rock record (Acasta Geniss ~4.03 Gyr) - after that, ~3.8 Gyr rocks exposed in several places.
* 4.4-3.8:
	* extensive recycling (**remixing**) of basaltic crust into mantle
* 4.0-3.85:
	* late heavy bombardment (highly distruptive but unlikely to destroy crust completely)
* 4.36-3.80:
	* limited felsic rocks (impact melts?) => produce zircons
* 4.40+-0.05:
	* mantle cools - basaltic crust forms
* 4.52
	* giant impact forms Moon - Earth melts
* 4.567
	* Earth accretion begins

### Archean Rocks
* associations include:
	* gneiss complexes
	* granite terranes
	* greenstone belts
* most common are granite-gneiss complexes
* abundant Archean granite terranes
* genisses include broad range of igneous compositions - granite to peridotite - and various metasedimentary rocks
* all have been metamorphosed
* Greenstone belts are subordinate in quantity but important for unraveling Archean history

![[Pasted image 20230303093714.png]]
> Pilbara, N.W. Australia

### Greenstone belts
* idea greensotone belt has 3 major units (working up):
	* mafic to ultramafic volcanic rock
	* mafic to felsic volcanic rocks
	* sedimentary rocks
* main features:
	* synclinal structure
	* intruded by granitic magma
	* cut by thrust faults
	* low-grade metamorphism - giving green color (chlorite)
![[Pasted image 20230303093857.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230303093915.png]]


#### Greenstone Belt Volcanics
* pillow lavas common indicating submarine volcanism
* ultramafic lavas (komatiites) also present suggesting very high temperature
* ~250C hotter than any modern lava
* hotter early Earth mantle due to greater radiogenic heat
#### Sedimentary Rocks of Greenstone Belts
* sedimentary rocks predominate in upper unit
* sedimentary succession and structures indicate of turbidite flow
	* ![[Pasted image 20230303094125.png]]
* other environments include deltas/shallow marine
#### Archean Turbidites
**![[Pasted image 20230303094206.png]]**
* Proximal - close
* Distal - distance

### Relationship of Greenstone Belts to Granite-Gneiss Complexes
* synclinal greenstone belts
* underlain by granite-gneiss complexes
	* relationships controversial
* intruded by granite
* major question is role of plalte tectonics in formation
![[Pasted image 20230303094314.png]]

#### Canadian Greenstone Belts
* NA greenstone belts (green)
	* Superior / Slave cratons of Canadian Shield
* oldest well-preserved greenstone belts ~3.6 Gyr (S. Africa, W. Australia)
![[Pasted image 20230303094509.png]]

#### Evolution of Greenstone Belts
* models for formation of greenstone belts
	* standard plate tectonics
	* modified plate tectonics
		* >3 Gyr
		* volcanic plumes

#### Archean Plate Tectonics
* history of plate tetonic processes (?)
* modern-style plate tectonic activity at least since Early Proterozoic & likely since late Archean
* common view is that plate tectonics occurred during earlier Archean but differed in detail from today
* Earthwas hotter due to greater radioactivity and more heat needed to be liberated @ surface
	* plates more abundant/smaller (AND/OR)
	* plates moved faster
	* more magma generation
	* high-temperature magmas (komatiites)

### Origin of Cratons & Continents
* *little stable* continent crust (cratons) existed at beginning of Archean
* *rapid amalgamation* of granite-gneiss-greenstone belts into stable cratons through subduction processes that evolved over time as plate tectonics developed
* during late Archean - Early Proterzoic, sedimentary evidence records widespread development of continental shelves were *rarely present* during Archean
* by end of Archean - *~50%* or more of present continental crust volume was in place
#### Superior Craton Evolution
* reenstone belts (dark green)
* granite-gneiss complexes (light green)
	* ![[Pasted image 20230303095219.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230303095140.png]]
* amalgamation of greenstone belts & granite-gneiss complexes by plate tectonics

### Atmosphere & Hydrosphere
- early atmosphere & hydrosphre diff. than today
- plays important role in development of biosphere
- current atmosphere relatively oxidizing - early atmosphere more likely neutral to reducing

### Present-day Atmosphere Composition
![[Pasted image 20230303095722.png]]

#### Atmospheric Evolution
* hydrogen/helium swept into outer solar system near Jupiter prior to accretion of Earth
* as Earth accreted, less gravity & absence of protective magnetic field => loss in space of earliest atmospheric componennts
* as Earth grew, gravity increased, core formed and magnetic field in place
* gases released by volcanic **outgassing** increasingly retained
	* heavier gases (e.g., Ar, Ne, CH4, NH3) more likely to be retained

#### Outgassing
* most abundant gases
	* H20 (steam)
	* CO2
* other components:
	* H2 (mostly lost to space), N2, CO, S, CI, etc
* current N2-rich atmosphere due to "loss" of CO2 into sedimentary rocks
* e.g., CaO + CO2 -> sedimentary rocks

### Atmospheric Evolution
* volcanic gases lack free oxygen (& ozone)
* earliest atmosphere likely dominated by CO2 and N2 with lesser ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) - reducing or at least neutral
* persisted during Hadean and into Archean
* evidence for early oxygen-free atmosphere
	* Archean sediments have detrital minerals that rapidly oxidize in presence of molecular oxygen (O2)
	* evidence for dissolved iron suggestion $Fe^{2+}$ rather than $Fe^{3+}$ 
	* Archean sediments mostly gray-green whereas young sediments often red (oxidizied)

### Oxygen Forming Processes
- atmospheric oxygen due to photochemical dissociation of water (minor) & photosynthesis (major)
- photochemical dissociation requires ultravioletic radiation - more efficient if ozone absent
- photosynthesis **requires** organism
- by end of Archean, <1% current levels of free oxygen

### Earth's Hydrosphere
- outgassing provided considerable amounts of water to surface
- fraction of surface water may have been derived from icy comets
	- directly by comet combardment of surface
	- indirectly by deliviring water to Earth durng accretion
- **oceans** certainly date to early Archean and likely present during later parts of Hadean
	- oldest rocks on Earth include sedimentary rocks
	- included are chemical precipitates and turbdites
	- size of oceans not known but likely formed at a rate faster than continents formed
	- water still outgassed but much volcanic water vapor is recycled surface water
